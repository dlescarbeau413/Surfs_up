# Surfs_up

The purpose for this analysis is to determine if the idea for a combined ice cream shop and surf shop is sustainable year-round in Hawaii. For this challenged we gathered data points on the temperature at the mid-point of the year (June) and the end of the year (December). For each time during the years, we were able to gather the summary statistics for each part of the year.
As you can see from the June data, average temperature in June reaches around 75 degrees. That temperature provides perfect weather for people to enjoy surfing then afterwards grabbing some ice cream.  Grabbing the temperature measurement for the mid-point of the year could be a good indication of what type of weather to expect for the rest of the summer and could determine how good business would be as the summer goes on. With summer time being peak tourism season, June weather is the perfect indicator of what to expect during the summer time months of July and August.  As we can see in my other query for the July Temps, the average temperature really doesn’t change a whole lot between June and July. The difference between the average temperatures for the two months is a 1 degree difference and that’s really not a whole lot. If we were to look at the min temperature from July and June there’s only a 3 degree difference from June to July. Again, not much variation. 
As we look at the December’s weather we can also determine that the temperature is good and can provide good weather for both surfing and grabbing ice cream. Even though the min temperature reaches below 60 degrees we can see the mean temperature stays above 70 and is a 5-degree difference from the midpoint of the year. To get the info and make sure that the numbers from December looked similar to the months before and after I wrote queries to get the summary data for the other months before and after December. Looking at the data, it appears that November, January and February temps are similar to the numbers for December. Again, the min, max and average differ slightly in the preceding and following months but not by a whole lot to make a huge difference. 

If we were to look at just the two data points we collected in the first two deliverables there are few differences in the data. 

•	The temperatures are a little more spread out in the dataset collected in December with a std of 3.7459 than in June which has a std of 3.2574 meaning the temperatures vary a lot more in December than in June. 

•	The max temperature in June is higher than in December. This is to be expected because during the summer months the weather is a warmer than in the winter months. The difference in the datapoints is a two or three point difference with the exception of the min temperature recorded which is a difference of 8 degrees from June to December. 

•	The other difference that I noticed that could attribute to the higher variation in the data summary is the number or records for both months is a little difference. December has about 200 less records than in the months of June. 

Additional information that we could look into would be looking into the temperature preceding and following the months collected. This is exactly what I did in order to come up with my recommendation to open the shop. All I did was refactor the code to gather the temperature summary for July, November, January and February months. The reason for gathering more of the months following December was because information on the slower months would be more of a determining factor because that’s when you would expect it to be the slower part of the year. As for in June and July you could get an idea of what the business months of august and September would be weatherwise. 
Another way I was able to refactor the code was by determining the precipitation amounts for the six month stretch between June and December and even after December to get an understanding of what other weather factors could determine the business outcomes. As far as precipitation, we can see that July is by far the month where the most rain has occurred. Other than that, we can see that the following months have moderate to very little rain fall. As you can see in the following images, the month with the most rain following June is the month of November.

As you can see by both the first two deliverable queries and the additional precipitation by month queries, I have provided enough information to show you that I do in fact believe that the combined surf and ice cream shop is a viable option.
